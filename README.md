• Handwritten Digit Classification makes use of the MNIST  dataset and K-Nearest Neighbor Classifier to predict the digit in the image.
• K-Nearest Neighbor is implemented using the euclidean distance metric, and an accuracy of 98.44% was acheived on K=1.
• Python Libraries such as scikit-learn and numpy where used to implement the model and find it's accuracy.
